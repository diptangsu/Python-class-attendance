# Python-class-attendance
I and [Koustav Chanda](https://github.com/KoustavCode) had organised a Python Skill Development Porgramme in our college.  
I had developed this website in order to monitor the attendance of the students who were selected for the course.  
The students were required to create an account. For every class of the programme, they had to login to give their attendance.  
The website generated a [calendar view](https://pythonaot.000webhostapp.com/admin/attendance.php) for each student displaying the dates on which they were present.
